Hello and thank you for purchasing Low Poly Home package.

There are 197 prefabs. 
All models use one atlas texture.
For most of the example scenes the lighting is set to baked indirect and realtime directional.

Texture is 512*512 png


Update 1.5
- Pack updated to Universal Render Pipeline.
- Fixed all the see trough issues. And made asset more clear to use.
- Realtime directional light for example scenes.
- Added example scene with post-processing setup.
